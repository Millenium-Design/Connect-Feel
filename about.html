         <div class ="update1"><h2>Cultural</h2>As men, we like to think of ourselves as strong and in control of our emotions. When we feel hopeless or overwhelmed by despair we often deny it or try to cover it up. But depression is a common problem that affects many of us at some point in our lives.
        Many men do not recognize, acknowledge, or seek help for their depression. They may be reluctant to talk about how they are feeling. But depression is a real and treatable illness. It can affect any man at any age. With the right treatment, most men with depression can get better and gain back their interest in work, family, and hobbies.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Effect</h2>suppressing emotions may increase the risk of dying from heart disease and certain forms of cancer.
        it creates a lot of unnecessary tension in your body, which can manifest as disease, or worse, death.
        Suppressing feelings during arguments, a practice known as “self-silencing,” has been linked to other risks as well, including depression, eating disorders and heart disease.
        Feeling sad or "empty"
        Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or angry
        Loss of interest in work, family, or once-pleasurable activities, including sex
        Feeling very tired
        Not being able to concentrate or remember details
        Not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Solution</h2>Medication isn’t your only option. Lifestyle changes can bring powerful relief.
        Staying connected to others is an essential part of depression treatment
        Regular exercise is a powerful antidepressant—it can be as effective as medication
        Therapy can teach you lasting skills to help you fight depression 
        See a professional as soon as possible. Research shows that getting treatment sooner rather than later can relieve symptoms quicker and reduce the length of time treatment is needed.
        Break up large tasks into small ones, and do what you can as you can. Don't try to do too many things at once.
        Spend time with other people and talk to a friend or relative about your feelings.
        Do not make important decisions until you feel better. Discuss decisions with others who know you well. </div>
